# SpaceX Rocket Launch Analysis & Prediction ðŸš€

This project dives into SpaceXâ€™s launch data to analyze, visualize, and predict first-stage landing success rates. It combines **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **geospatial visualization** to uncover insights that could optimize future rocket launches.

## **Key Highlights**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified factors influencing launch success, such as payload mass, orbit types, and booster technology.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Created a dashboard using Dash to explore success rates by site, payload range, and other variables.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Built and evaluated predictive models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN) to estimate landing outcomes with over **83% accuracy**.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Used Folium to visualize launch site proximities to coastlines, highways, and cities, emphasizing strategic placement.

## **Questions Addressed**

1. **What factors determine a successful SpaceX rocket landing?**
2. **Which variables most influence first-stage success rates?**
3. **How accurately can we estimate launch costs by predicting first-stage success?**

## **Results**

- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression, offering high accuracy and interpretability.
- **Key Indicators**: Moderate payload mass, reusable boosters, and specific orbit types were strong predictors of success.
- **Insights for Cost Optimization**: Landing success predictions provide a foundation for estimating and optimizing SpaceX's reusability strategies.
